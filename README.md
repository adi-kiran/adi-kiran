<h1 align='center'> Hello There! 👋</h1>

👨‍💻 I'm Adithya Kiran, a software enthusiast who enjoys working on machine learning and scalable software systems!

📖 I'm recently graduated with my Master's degree in Computer Science from **North Carolina State University**! At NCSU I focused on the domains of Data Science, Machine Learning and Systems.

🏢 I've worked at **Kickdrum Technologies** and **ScienceLogic** collaborating closely with driven individuals from various development, devops and delivery teams, to develop and deploy clean, scalable and extensible cloud based solutions.

🔧 **Tech Stack** - I mostly work with **Python** and **Java** in the backend and **React** in the frontend. I have worked with **AWS** as the cloud platform at both Kickdrum and ScienceLogic. Here are a few technologies I am well-versed with:
