<h1 align='center'> Hello There! üëã</h1>

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm Adithya Kiran, a software enthusiast who enjoys working on machine learning and scalable software systems!

üìñ I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at **North Carolina State University** and will be graduating in May 2025. At NCSU I am focusing on my interests in the domain of Data Science, Machine Learning and Systems.

üåû This summer I worked as an **SRE Intern** at **ScienceLogic** in Reston, VA. I worked with brilliant teammates to enhance the monitoring capabilities of the SL1 Platform and reduce manual efforts by developing automations. Some interesting things I worked on:
- A Jenkins job to migrate a SaaS service from Oracle Linux 7 machines to Oracle Linux 8 machines and uprade the application, using Python and bash scripts
- A log file parsing application that alerts when there are dataflow or syncronization issues with log files and provides statistics on the number and types of errors found in the logs.

üè¢ Previously, I've worked as a **Software Engineer** at **Kickdrum Technologies** - in Bangalore, India - working on various projects using a variety of technologies. I worked closely with driven individuals from various development, devops and delivery teams, to develop and deploy clean, scalable and extensible cloud based solutions. Some interesting projects that I worked on at Kickdrum:
- Desiged a search engine with filtering capabilities for semi-structured documents, 
- Developed an application for migrating millions of medical images from legacy servers to AWS S3 without overloading the servers,
- Refactored a massive monolith Java application with more then 200 packages (lots of cyclical dependencies) into a service oriented architecture based application.

üîß **Tech Stack** - I mostly work with **Python** and **Java** in the backend and **React** in the frontend. I have worked with **AWS** as the cloud platform at both Kickdrum and ScienceLogic. Here are a few technologies I am well versed with:

üå± I am currently learning about Graph Neural Networks and PySpark.

üåü I would love to collaborate on interesting machine learning and big data projects! Please reach out if you are looking for collaborators on projects.
