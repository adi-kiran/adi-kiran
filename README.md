<h1 align='center'> Hello There! üëã</h1>

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm Adithya Kiran, a software enthusiast who enjoys working on machine learning and scalable software systems!

üìñ I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at **North Carolina State University** and will be graduating in May 2025. At NCSU I am focusing on the domains of Data Science, Machine Learning and Systems.

üåû Last summer (2024) I worked as an **SRE Intern** at **ScienceLogic** in Reston, VA. I worked with brilliant people in the SRE team and helped enhance the monitoring capabilities of the SL1 Platform and reduced manual efforts by developing automations for important processes. Some interesting projects I worked on:
- A Jenkins job to automate the migration(from Oracle Linux 7 to Oracle Linux 8) and upgrading of a SaaS service, using Python and bash scripts
- A log file parsing application that alerts when there are dataflow or syncronization issues with log files and provides statistics on the number and types of errors found in the logs.

üè¢ Previously, I've worked as a **Software Engineer** at **Kickdrum Technologies** - in Bangalore, India - working on various projects using a variety of technologies. I worked closely with driven individuals from various development, devops and delivery teams, to develop and deploy clean, scalable and extensible cloud based solutions. Some interesting projects that I worked on at Kickdrum:
- Desiged and deploed a search engine with filtering capabilities for semi-structured and unstructured documents using Elasticsearch, Python and React,
- Refactored a massive monolith Java application with more then 200 packages (containing lots of cyclical dependencies) into a service oriented architecture based application,
- Developed a webapp that can analyze an AWS account for resource usage and security and data reliability issues by assuming a role with read-only permissions without installing/setting up anything on the account like Config/ControlTower/etc.

üîß **Tech Stack** - I mostly work with **Python** and **Java** in the backend and **React** in the frontend. I have worked with **AWS** as the cloud platform at both Kickdrum and ScienceLogic. Here are a few technologies I am well-versed with:

üå± I am currently learning about Graph Neural Networks and PySpark.

üåü I would love to collaborate on interesting machine learning and big data projects! Please reach out if you are looking for collaborators on projects.
